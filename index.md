Welcome to the U of I Library Data and Digital Services workflow website, where you'll find information relating to digitization, processing, metadata, and other tasks.

If you are a **student** working on a Digital Initiatives or Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL) project, the first five tabs (Overview -> Students) will be most relevant to your work.

If you are a **community member** interested in our workflow, please refer to the last "Community" tab for further information about digitization.
